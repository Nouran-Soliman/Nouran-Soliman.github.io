I am interested in research and I am looking forward to completing my graduate studies. I am a research intern at Adobe Creative Intelligence Lab, SF, USA. And I am an [Adobe Women In Tech Scholarship]() Winner. I have scratched the surface of wireless applications, HCI, computer vision, computer graphics and machine learning. I am currently interested to explore more in those fields and I am also very opened to learning more about other fields. I am looking for undergraduate research internships for spring and summer. My CV with more details about my projects, awards and services can be found [here](). Not to forget my [transcripts]().",
