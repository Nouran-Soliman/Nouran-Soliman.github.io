MATE center's 2015 call ensued the innovation of Lord Of The Arctic (LOTA), the ROV designed and constructed
by Blue ROVotics to perform the challenging tasks assigned, under harsh circumstances including darkness because
of the freezing ice, with high veracity, to deploy instruments, gather data, and replace. LOTA has its driving station,
Tether deployment system with a 25-meter VideoRay neutrally buoyant umbilical, and an Ethernet communication
along with a joystick interface used in implementing a dynamic positioning system to overcome waves. Seven HD IP
cameras are used to ensure a full-angle view for the surroundings and payloads, facilitating the processes of counting,
identifying, and the measuring which is achieved using the 3rd-class laser. Working in this polar environment requires
meticulousness, achieved with 2 parallel-jaw grippers to carry heavy objects with fine grip. The Polyethylene durable
frame, ensures conveniently low drag, banishing obstructions to thrusters with brushless vector motors.
Our company's vision included safety as of equal importance to efficiency of technicality. Each component is chosen
carefully to fit safely, and testing was done throughout each stage to ensure that LOTA met our standards. This is why
LOTA is supplemented with auto-power to switch it off in cases of emergency and a shield is used on the laser to avoid
any possible harm above ground. LOTA is the result of Blue ROVotics' tough grind for consecutive months under a
precise time plan. This technical report explicates how Blue ROVotics brought LOTA to reality from mere theories,
comprising the detailed process.
